this project was my first implementation using python and raspberry pi + hardware to make a very basic Petoi Robot Cat Nybble type robot in a robotics class. 
the main functions I had to build were face recognition so that the robot can recognize its owner, and using the ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance 
from objects so that using them the robot can later avoid obstacles and perform various functions with the camera.
